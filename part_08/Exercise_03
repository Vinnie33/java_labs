Using MySQLWorkbench do the following

1) create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

2) create a new table named "clients" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)
    - dealerID (refers to user in users table who is the car dealer)

    CREATE TABLE `car_dealership`.`clients` (
      `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `userID` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
      `carID` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
      `dealerID` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (`id`));

2) create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

    CREATE TABLE `car_dealership`.`users` (
      `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `first_name` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
      `last_name` VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (`id`));

3) create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year (had issue with making datatype "year()", program default was VARCHAR)

4) populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

5) Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)
    - select all records from clients
        SELECT *
        FROM car_dealership.clients;
    - select all records from clients (did you mean cars?)where car make = "Toyota"
         SELECT *
         FROM car_dealership.clients (or FROM car_dealership.cars)
         WHERE make = 'Toyota';
    - use a join to select all makes and models that a dealer has sold
         SELECT clients.carID, clients.dealerID, cars.make, cars.model
         FROM clients
         INNER JOIN cars ON clients.id = cars.id;

    - use a left join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car

        SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name, c.color
        FROM Users u
        LEFT JOIN clients cl
        ON u.id = cl.userID
        JOIN cars c
        ON c.id = cl.carID
        WHERE c.color = "red";

    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table


    - create a new table named "test" with at least two fields
        CREATE TABLE shoes (
        id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        style VARCHAR (150),
        color VARCHAR (150),
        size DOUBLE,
        );
    - use sql to drop the the "test" table
        DROP TABLE shoes;
    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table
        UPDATE

6) Using MySQLWorkbench, export the the "clients", "users" and "cars" schema with all objects and data into a
self-contained sql file. - check the exported file into git
